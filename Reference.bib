   abstract = {<p>The time required for a given quantum system to evolve is known as the quantum speed limit (QSL), which can be used to characterize the speed of evolution of a quantum system. We study QSL time for Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Investigating the effect of QSL under non-unitary evolution is of fundamental interest. In this work, we derive QSL time for maximally entangled state and apply its results under various noise channels. We discuss measure of QSL, how correlations affect the rate of QSL. Further, we carried an investigation on connection between non-Markovianity and QSL. We show that the non Markovian evolution can speed up quantum evolution, therefore lead to smaller QSL time. We have established the connections between correlated channels, information loss and non-Markovianity. This theory may suggest some further connections to retrieve back information from surrounding and preserves decoherence.</p>},

One must choose the appropriate benchmark and metrics to extract meaningful results. Different benchmarks test the system in different ways, and each individual metric may or may not be of interest. Choosing the appropriate approach is tricky. The situation is even more open ended for quantum computers, where there is a wider range of hardware, fewer established guidelines, and additional complicating factors. Notably, quantum noise significantly impacts performance and is difficult to model accurately. Here, we discuss benchmarking of quantum computers from a computer architecture perspective and provide numerical simulations highlighting challenges that suggest caution.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>We investigate the dynamics of a maximally entangled mixed state (MEMS) under the action of correlated noise channels. The channel acts in a way that its successive uses are correlated. We have studied the MEMS properties, including quantum coherence and entanglement. For partially correlated channels, both the entanglement and coherence of MEMS are found to decay much slower than those of the memoryless channels. Moreover, we observe a freezing effect of coherence for phase damping as well as depolarizing channels and freezing of entanglement for phase-damping channels with perfect memory. For amplitude damping and depolarizing channels, memory helps in either delaying the sudden death of entanglement or slowing the decay rate of coherence. These observations suggest that memory channels perform better than memoryless channels in maintaining the integrity of quantum states and have utility in quantum information processing protocols.</p>},

Moreover, the protection of entanglement in quantum noise channels without memory in contrast to the results of the channels with memory is more effective. For | <italic>ψ</italic> 〉 or | <italic>ϕ</italic> 〉, we also find that the memory parameters play a significant role in the suppression of entanglement sudden death and the initial entanglement can be drastically amplified. Another more important result is that the relationship between the concurrence, the memory parameter, the weak measurement strength, and quantum measurement reversal strength is found through calculation and discussion. It provides a strong basis for the system to maintain maximum entanglement in the nosie channel. </p>},

   abstract = {In recent years, a large number of experiments aimed at the verification of fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, such as the Bell's inequality test of quantum nonlocality, have been realized by adopting photon particles mutually interacting according the celebrated methods of non-linear optics (NLO). In addition, the sophisticated NLO methods have been extended to relevant investigations and realizations in the domain of the emerging new sciences of Quantum Information (QI) and Quantum Communication. Indeed NLO has proved to be an excellent theoretical and experimental test bench for the novel concepts introduced by QI. The present work is intended to survey the most relevant quantum processes investigated by NLO by focusing on the generation and on the manipulation of entangled photon states by the three-wave NL parametric processes. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
